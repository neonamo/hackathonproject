    Amazing story of Lithuanian carriers. “If you can sleep in the cabin during
    your holiday, why not during your work time?”

      “Every month, in the Western countries of the EU, at least four carriers
      from Lithuania get tickets for night rest of the drivers in the truck
      cabins,” informed the Lithuanian Association of Road Carriers Linava. To
      show that sleeping in the cabin is very comfortable, the association has
      decided to organize an educational campaign for tourists and offer them a
      night in the truck cabin instead of the hotel. Its members want to show
      that the EU rules on the night rest of drivers are out of touch with
      reality. The organizers pose one simple question: if people can spend a
      night in the truck during their holidays, why they must not do this while
      at work?
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      We would like to draw attention to the very unfavourable regulations for
      professional drivers. Drivers do not want to leave their vehicles
      unattended and spend their night rest in the hotels. We often hear the
      stories that trucks left in parking lots were stolen, and not all the
      insurance companies pay damages if the vehicle was unattended,” said
      Andius Petraitis, Spokesman of Linava.

      He meant the ban of taking a 45-hour rest period in the truck cabin which
      is applied in some EU countries. According to Petraitis, the law is very
      unjust and even harmful because the driver can only choose between getting
      a ticket and a restless night.

      So, in the parking lot in Palanga, the Association parked a purple Renault
      Gama T truck and made it available for everyone: residents and tourists.
      The organizers wanted to show that modern trucks are very comfortable and
      that resting in them is not different than resting in the hotel. It turned
      out, there were a lot of people eager to spend a night in the cabin.

    <blockquote class="quote">
      We did not realize that the truck is so comfortable. The driver’s cabin is
      spacious, the beds are comfortable, and air conditioning and a fridge
      protected us and our drinks from the swelter. We are sure that we would
      prefer a truck cabin over a rented room,” shared their impressions
      Dominyka Kvaraciejūtė and Giedrė Gudiškytė on the website 15min.lt.

      The campaign enjoyed especially a huge interest of the truckers spending
      their holidays by the sea.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      I spent a lot of nights in a truck cabin and I do not see anything wrong
      in it,” said driver Artur. “Of course, it is more comfortable in the
      hotel, but still it is better to save 50 euro and spend it here, by the
      sea.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The driver said that the truckers from Lithuania spend only 5 percent of
      their nights on the road in the hotels. They usually just sleep in their
      trucks. Of course, risking a ticket.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      The fines for sleeping in the cabin are high. They start at 500 euro and
      reach 30 thousand euro for sleeping regularly in the vehicle. We want to
      draw attention to this problem and change the law, at least in a way that
      drivers sleeping in their vehicles in parking lots will not be punished
      with fines, as is the case in the UK,” said Petraitis.
